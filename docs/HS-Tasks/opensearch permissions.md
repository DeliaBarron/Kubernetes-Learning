opensearch permissions

add permissions to new user


we use it for logs, chriis need permissions for user support

we provide logs and we can just give permissions
we have the keykloac ui
then search for the user name of the companny the ask for modifications
in this case support at frederix

go to the user of yours , then you can swithc tenants

 keycloak under the fsupport (user windo) you can impersionate so as you use it you can now go toi opensearch to log in and see if you can access as the new user
